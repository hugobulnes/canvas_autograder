The script will make an http request using canvas api to get all the students submission for a specific assignment. Then it will download all the students projects into a working directory for the grader to process.  

### Execute the grader commands

In this part the script will execute your custom commands to grade the student assignment using the downloaded project and store a feedback string and a grade into two separeted variables

### Post the Score (Grade of the assignment) and feedback

This will post the submission grade to canvas once generated by your script and send the feedback text to the student.
